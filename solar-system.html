        <p class = "ssintro"> The Solar System contains eight planets that are gravitationally bound around the Sun, with the Earth as the third closest. Each planet's orbit is within the same plane. Alongside the four terrestrial planets and the four gas giants, there are millions of other rogue objects such as asteroids, comets, and meteors circling the Solar System all at once. Humanity has sent spacecraft as far as Neptune (Voyager 2), but the outer reaches of the Solar System are still largely unexplored. </p>

Interestingly, a day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus because it takes Venus longer to rotate on its axis than it takes for it to circle the Sun. Venus is also sometimes called Earth's Twin due to their similar compositions and sizes, but Venus turned into a hostile planet with an atmosphere of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid clouds that trap heat.
