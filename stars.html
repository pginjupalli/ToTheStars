      <p class = "intro-p-stars">A star is a luminous sphere of plasma that's held together by gravity so strong, fusion occurs. In the universe, there are many different types of stars. They each form in different ways and have different appearances. They also have distinct properties and behaviors. If one is going to study astronomy, the different types of stars are a must to learn about.</p>

          <li>This is a protostar, which is a star is the earliest phase of stellar evolution</li>
          <li>It forms when a molecular cloud undergos self-gravity, causing a core to emerge</li>
          <li>The more mass the star has, the faster it will undergo change</li>
          <li>This phase may take anywhere from 100,000 years to 100 million</li>
          <li>Some examples of protostars are T Tauri, HL Tauri, and W33A</li>

          <li>Their size ranges from 15 times the mass of Jupiter to 75 times</li>
          <li>They can take about 10 million years to cool down after formation</li>

          <li>Their sizes can range from .84 to 1.14 times that of out Sun</li>
          <li>They can burn for 10 billion years before turning into a red giant</li>

          <li>Red giants can last from a few thousand to a billion years</li>
          <li>They can become anywhere from 100 to 1,000 times as big as our Sun</li>
